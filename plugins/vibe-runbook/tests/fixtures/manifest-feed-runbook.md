# Game-manifest feed — go-live runbook

Operational runbook for taking the remote game-definition feed from "machinery ready" to "games update from a live feed." Companion to the roadmap spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-12-game-manifest-roadmap-design.md`). Living doc — update as steps land.

## Where we are

**The feed is LIVE as of launcher v0.6.0.** The full loop runs end to end: the separate public `626-game-manifest` repo publishes a signed `games-manifest.json`, and the launcher fetches it, verifies the ECDSA P-256 detached signature against the pinned public key, validates/gates it, and merges it over the embedded manifest at startup — falling back silently to the embedded manifest on any failure (offline, bad signature, schema too new). Games update from a live feed; a new game on a known engine is now a data PR to the feed repo, no app release.

The in-app machinery is complete and merged: the manifest behind facades (Phase 0), the trust core that verifies/loads/merges a remote manifest, the facade wiring + `SetRemote` hook, the pinned ECDSA P-256 public key, and `ManifestLoader.TryApplyRemote` — the one-call entry point (verify against the pinned key → validate/gate → make effective, fall back to embedded on any failure). App-side, `RemoteManifestSource` fetches + caches the feed and applies it at startup before any facade reads; the "auto-update definitions" toggle (default on, ~24h debounced) gates it. The feed repo's signing CI runs **weekly + on `overrides/` changes**, signing the mined-facts manifest from the `MANIFEST_SIGNING_KEY` secret.

## The sequence (dependency order)

Each step is tagged **[you]** (maintainer action) or **[me]** (agent builds it).

| # | Step | Who | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | App-side `RemoteManifestSource` (fetch → cache → `TryApplyRemote` at startup) + "auto-update definitions" toggle | **[me]** | nothing — buildable now, ships dark (no URL = no-op) | **Done (v0.6.0)** |
| 2 | Feed miner (C# in-repo tool: Ludusavi/Vortex/MO2 → draft `games-manifest.json` + diff) | **[me]** | nothing — produces an unsigned draft | **Done** (`tools/ManifestMiner/`) |
| 3 | Review the draft manifest | **[you]** | step 2 | Ongoing — the per-PR curation gate |
| 4 | Pre-publish legal sign-off | **[you]** | can decide anytime | **Done (2026-06-13)** |
| 5 | CI signing (Actions secret + signing step) | **[you] + [me]** | the keypair (done); the feed repo (step 6) | **Done** (feed-repo CI, weekly + on `overrides/`) |
| 6 | Publish the feed + wire the real URL | **[you] + [me]** | steps 3–5 | **Done (v0.6.0)** — `FeedUrl` wired |
| 7 | Flip the toggle default + ship a release | **[me]** | step 6 | **Done (v0.6.0)** — default on |

## Your actions, in detail

### Action — Pre-publish legal sign-off (decide anytime)

**Not legal advice.** The research (2026-06-13, cited in spec §8) established as **fact**: the data we publish — Steam/GOG/Epic app IDs, game names, engine keys, mod-folder paths, Nexus slugs — are **uncopyrightable facts** under *Feist v. Rural*, 499 U.S. 340; the US has no sweat-of-the-brow or sui-generis database right. Mining these facts into our own schema engages **none** of the source licenses (Ludusavi MIT, Vortex GPL-3, MO2 MIT, PCGamingWiki CC BY-NC-SA 3.0).

Two conditions keep that true, and both are already our design:
1. **Facts only** — never copy prose, fix-instructions, or a source's selection/arrangement wholesale.
2. **Cross-verify** each datum against a second primary source (Steam store/SteamDB for IDs, the game's own install tree for paths) so the manifest's arrangement is demonstrably our own curation.

**The judgment that's yours:** are you comfortable publishing on that basis for a **free, not-sold** app? Caveats: if the app is ever sold, re-open the NonCommercial analysis; PCGamingWiki blocks automated fetching (HTTP 403) — that's a Terms-of-Service/access matter *separate* from copyright, so we hand-curate, never bulk-scrape. Optional belt-and-suspenders: a one-paragraph counsel read before the feed goes live.

**Decision (2026-06-13): SIGNED OFF — proceed facts-only.** The app stays free / not-sold; mining is facts-only + cross-verified per the two conditions above. Resolves spec §11 #6. (Re-open only if the app is ever sold.)

### Action — Feed repo decision (decide anytime)

Where the signed feed lives:
- **Separate public `626-game-manifest` repo** (recommended) — clean separation: public schema + hand-curated `overrides/` + the generated manifest + signing CI. The spec's design; keeps the data side independent of the launcher release cycle.
- **Release asset on this repo** — zero new repo, simplest, but mixes feed data into launcher releases and couples the two cycles.

**Decision (2026-06-13): separate public `626-game-manifest` repo.** Schema + hand-curated `overrides/` + generated manifest + signing CI live there; the launcher only consumes the signed output.

### Action — CI signing secret (in the FEED repo, once it exists)

The signing CI runs in the separate `626-game-manifest` repo, so the secret lives **there**, not in the launcher repo. When that repo exists:
1. GitHub → **`626-game-manifest`** repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**.
2. Name it exactly **`MANIFEST_SIGNING_KEY`**.
3. Paste the full PKCS#8 PEM **multi-line, verbatim** (the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` … `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` block, line breaks intact — do NOT flatten to one line; .NET `ImportFromPem` needs the PEM structure) from your password manager.
4. Save.

It pastes straight from the password manager into GitHub (encrypted at rest) and never touches disk again. **Timing: hold until the feed repo exists** — drafts are unsigned, so nothing needs the key before then; keep it in your password manager meanwhile. The signer (a C# step using `ECDsa` + `DSASignatureFormat.IeeeP1363FixedFieldConcatenation`, matching the verify side) reads it from the secret via an env var (never interpolated into a shell line, so multi-line survives); it never appears in source.

### Action — Review the draft manifest (when the miner runs)

Once the miner emits the draft `games-manifest.json` + diff report, skim for:
- engine classifications correct (a wrong engine = wrong mod handling);
- `modPath` sane and **never** absolute or `..`-bearing (the validator rejects those, but eyes help);
- store IDs / Nexus slugs plausible;
- anything that belongs in the curated `overrides/` (where your corrections beat the mined value).

This is the curation gate — your review is the quality bar before anything gets signed.

## Key rotation (reference)

The public key is pinned in `ModManager.Core` (`ManifestSigningKey.PublicKeySpki`). Rotation = mint a new ECDSA P-256 keypair, update the `MANIFEST_SIGNING_KEY` secret, re-pin the new public key, and ship a release. Because the key is pinned in the binary, rotation is a release — there is no separate revocation channel (matches the spec's "no key-rotation machinery" non-goal).

## After go-live

A new game on an engine the binary already knows is a **data PR** to the feed — no app release. A new *engine* is still code (a release), per the layer-3 law. Freshness without a release was the whole point.
